# Sonarr ReConnect

The extension gives the ability to show Sonarr activities like: History, Wanted/Missing, upcoming shows and an overview of all your shows with status straight in Google Chrome. It also shows a badge in your Chrome browser which shows how many episodes are wanted/missing. So you know when to take action without checking Sonarr very often.

Set up the extension: <br />
1. Install via Chrome storage <br />
2. Open the config page (right click on Sonarr extension icon).  <br />
--- it's best to copy and paste your URL and API key  <br />
3. Open the extension. <br />
